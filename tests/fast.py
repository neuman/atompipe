"""The fast tier: every invariant's violation tests, in at most 90 seconds.

The full suite is 10-17 minutes (measured 2026-10-03, one process per module:
~830 s summed, `test_admission` alone 120-150 s). A loop that waits that long
per edit stops running it, and an iteration that runs nothing between edits is
where an invariant breaks unseen. So this tier runs EACH ITERATION, and the full
suite (`discover -s tests`) still runs before EACH CHECKPOINT AND EACH COMMIT.
Nothing here replaces anything there: every entry in ``FAST`` is a test the full
suite also runs, and the only tests that live in this file check the list itself.
What this tier promises is narrower than "green means no invariant is red": at
least one violation test of every invariant runs every iteration, and a break
that only a test in ``LEFT_FOR_THE_GATE`` sees is caught by the escalation rule
below or by the full suite, not here.

The budget is 90 s as ONE process on an otherwise idle machine. The merge of phase 3b
into phase 6 keeps both lists whole (both paid with test_meta.NoGitOutsideVcs;
test_meta.InvariantClassesNeverSkip, which phase 6's review made 0.6 s, is out of the
tier as phase 3b left it). Measured on 2026-10-15 as two interleaved pairs against
3d8eaaf (load average 1.4-2.4, not idle): 122.9 s and 119.5 s wall (89.9 s and 87.3 s
user) for its 685 tests, against 118.1 s and 114.4 s (85.9 s and 83.7 s user) for
3d8eaaf's 662 — about 4 s over its base, which is over the line: the next change that
touches the tier pays that first. The follow-up after phase 3b did not: it added
test_style.TheSiteSaysABuiltPart (~0.18 s warm) and paid ~0.1 s of it by reading the
template's strings once per process (test_style.template_strings). Measured once on
2026-10-15 at load 0.8-2.7, not paired against its base: 106.2 s wall (76.2 s user)
for its 692 tests. Its second commit (a recorded result coloured by its token) added
~0.15 s: test_site_truth's counted fail, recorded and baked in process (~0.1 s warm),
and TheBrowserComputesNoTruth's token row; 101.5 s wall (73.8 s user) for 694 tests at
load 0.2-1.2, unpaired. The review of
architecture phase 6 added ~1.2 s in the tier (invariant 8's identity and `init`
clauses: three in-process identity rows, two `init` rows, and the nested repository
in the staging class) and paid ~1.2 s by parsing each test file once in
test_meta.InvariantClassesNeverSkip (1.8 s to 0.6 s with the modules loaded, the same
assertions). Measured on 2026-10-15 as two interleaved pairs against 63e9cef on a
machine other sessions were loading (load average 2.3-3.9, not idle): 127.2 s and
138.7 s wall (92.9 s and 101.7 s user) for its 662 tests, against 161.2 s and 149.4 s
(109.8 s and 106.2 s user) for 63e9cef's 656 — not slower than its base, and over the
line as its base is. Architecture phase
6 (rounds and the plugin) added its invariant 8 class,
test_round.TheRoundCommitStagesOnlyTheProjectsPaths (~0.4 s in the tier, warm; ~1.5 s
alone: a bracket in a subtree committed in process twice, the checker's planted rows
and the closed list), and doctor's `people` row in the records sweeps (a git question
or two per `doctor`). It paid ~1.25 s, none an invariant class, each named where it
was: test_meta.NoGitOutsideVcs (~0.9 s) and five small entries
(test_prerequisites.PlanIsStable's three rows, test_goalposts.Margins and
AClaimReadIsTheWholeRecord, test_context.MalformedContextsAreRefused and
NoContextMovesNothing). Measured on 2026-10-15 as two interleaved pairs against
e27e1a7 (load average 0.8-1.5, not idle): 123.8 s and 123.1 s wall (91.0 s and 91.7 s
user) for its 656 tests, against 120.0 s and 134.5 s (88.8 s and 97.9 s user) for
e27e1a7's 665 — flat within this machine's noise, and over the line here as its base
is; the next change that adds pays first. Architecture
phase 3b (the trace) added ~2.1 s of in-process rows (the trace's key, its writer,
amber's currency on the committed amber file, the map's checker, an amber
evaluation's writes, one CLI refusal) and paid ~3.6 s: test_meta.InvariantClassesNeverSkip
and test_meta.NoGitOutsideVcs (harness guards, no invariant) to the full suite; its
real workers and the bracket traced afresh are the gate's. Measured on 2026-10-15 as
interleaved pairs against e27e1a7 on a machine other sessions were loading (load
average 1.5-3.0, not idle): 134.4 s and 116.4 s wall (100.0 s and 86.4 s user) for
its 674 tests against 126.3 s and 121.1 s (93.7 s and 89.1 s user) for e27e1a7's 665
— +8 s in one pair and -5 s in the other, within that machine's noise and not shown
under the line; an earlier pair before the pay-back read 112.5 s against 106.4 s.
The review of
architecture phase 5 added ~0.3 s (its in-process rows: a Failing claim never worded
inside its limit, the project's group, a claim named from another board, the checker
over baked prose, the scan's units) and paid ~2.9 s: the two records-sweep rows
phase 5 added (`site stamp --all`, `site badge`, ~1.8 s) to tests of their own left
to the gate, and test_meta.NoSubprocessOutsideRun (~1.1 s, a harness guard) to the
full suite, so the ~2.5 s phase 5 left standing is paid. Measured on 2026-10-15 as
two interleaved pairs against c392078 (load average 0.9-2.2, not idle: the base
itself ran 113-114 s on that machine, where the data side had measured 96.5 s): 110.3
s and 113.9 s wall (83.2 s and 85.3 s user) for its 665 tests, against 113.0 s and
114.1 s (85.4 s and 86.4 s user) for c392078's 661. Under its base, not shown under
the line: no idle run was had, so the next change that adds pays first. Architecture
phase 5's template side added ~0.25 s (`TheBrowserComputesNoTruth` and the template's style
scan, both source scans) and paid ~1.5 s: test_meta.EnvIsFaithful and
test_meta.NoTestShadowsTheFramework to the full suite (harness guards, no invariant;
named where `test_meta` was). Measured on 2026-10-15 as interleaved pairs against the
data side's ea175d5 on a machine other sessions were loading (load average 1.0-10.6,
not idle): 103.7 s and 99.9 s wall (76.2 s and 74.3 s user) for its 661 tests against
115.1 s and 108.4 s (85.0 s and 80.1 s user) for ea175d5's 660 (a third pair, 197 s
against 116 s, ran beside another session's suite and is not counted). Not slower than
its base, and still over the line on that machine: the rest the data side left (below)
stands, and the next change that touches the tier pays first. Architecture phase 5
(the site) is OVER the line, said here rather than hidden: two interleaved pairs on
2026-10-15 (load average 0.6-1.6) measured 96.5 s and 97.7 s wall (71.5-72.2 s user)
for its 661 tests, against 89.4 s and 93.8 s (68.6-69.5 s user) for fe9f6e3's 647.
What it added, by `--durations` against the same base (~3.8 s of test time): its
invariant 14 and 12 rows and the groups record in process (~0.9 s, after sharing one
bracket copy and its resolution across the in-process rows: first written, they cost
~2.5 s), the two rows the design added to both records sweeps, `site stamp --all` and
`site badge` (~1.8 s, kept: a command that writes is what those sweeps exist to
catch), the site register's sentences in the hardware-clause rows (~0.3 s) and the
meta scans over four more test modules (~0.4 s). What it paid (~1.2 s): to the full
suite, test_cache.PairedEntries, test_packs.NoLeakedProvenance,
test_prerequisites.ApplyingTheRuleTwiceMovesNothing and the graph's four neighbours
(none an invariant class, each named where it was); to the gate, the number scan's
build row. The rest (~2.5 s) stands: the next change that touches the fast tier pays
it back first. The review of
phase 3a added ~1.3 s (the evaluator edit that reads behind, the hand-bumped schema,
the forgery read back through five more readers, the doctor row) and paid ~1.3 s:
the doctor row to the gate, and the graph's and the round record's bytes on another
path to the full suite. Measured as two interleaved pairs on 2026-10-15 under a load
of 1.9-2.6 (not idle): 109.0 s and 92.5 s wall (68.8-68.9 s user) for its 647 tests,
against 96.2 s and 92.5 s (68.1-68.3 s user) for 6440bad's 647 — flat on wall in the
quieter pair, +0.6 s user: at the line, so the next change that adds pays first.
Architecture phase 3a (the graph and the round record) paid back what it added and measured flat,
within the machine's noise, as two interleaved pairs in one session on 2026-10-14
(load average 0.8-1.4): 92.0 s and 92.6 s wall (68.0-68.3 s user) for its 647 tests,
against 92.5 s and 92.3 s (67.5-67.7 s user) for c26fcd5's 767 — at the line, so the
next change that adds pays first. What it added (~3.8 s): its invariant classes'
in-process rows (`round` beside every other command, the source scan with its planted
reader, a resealed forgery, the record against the composition, the behind states,
an edge moving no status), the graph's in-process neighbours, and `round`'s watched
run in the records sweep (~1.3 s). What it paid, measured first at +5 s wall and then
in three steps: test_vocabulary.QualificationWordsComeFromOneTable, test_freshness,
test_readers and test_trace to the full suite — none an invariant class, each named
where it was. Architecture
phase 2 (decisions keep their losers) paid back what it added and measured flat,
within the machine's noise, as two rounds of two interleaved pairs in one session on
2026-10-14 (load average 0.9-2.2): 91.3 s and 98.3 s, then 94.1 s and 94.4 s wall
(66.8-69.0 s user) for its 764 tests, against 89.4 s and 91.5 s, then 92.7 s and
95.2 s (65.5-69.6 s user) for e138fc8's 775 — at the line, not under it, so the next
change that adds pays first. What it added (~3.5 s): its invariant classes'
in-process rows (~1.9 s: `prefer` over every agent marker, a pipe, another identity
and a mistyped id, each with its planted violator; a nominee alone; the sealed file's
tamperings; the binding to what the person read; a return condition read only on a
Checked claim, `check`'s *may return* and every reader agreeing; basis never a
status, a key or a qualification route; a proposer never an evaluator), the
`why <decision>` row in both records sweeps (~0.9 s) and the bracket's decision in
every sweep's index. What it paid (~3.8 s): its own rows of no invariant class
(the typed rejection's reader, the earlier seals pinned, every bundled basis, an
input's looked-up basis, the packs line), the writer scan and its subprocess rows
to the gate; `propose`'s listing out of the records sweeps (it reads pack.json files
only; `propose`'s writes are held by test_proposers and the phase's writers row);
and six entries of no invariant class to the full suite, each named where it was:
test_stdlib_only (CI's first step runs the same walk), test_codeload,
test_vocabulary.StatusWordsComeFromOneTable, test_admission.SweepOrder,
test_prerequisites.UnselectedDependentFollowsTheSweep and
test_louder.WorstIsTheMostUrgent. Architecture phase 1 (requirements and mechanisms) paid back what it added, measured as two
interleaved pairs in one session on 2026-10-14 (load average 0.7-2.3): 92.3 s and
89.8 s wall (65.5 s user) for its 769 tests, against 90.4 s and 91.3 s wall (67.4-67.7 s
user) for 94b9963's 751. What it added (~4 s): its invariant classes' in-process rows
(~1.5 s: the seal pinned across both spellings, both spellings keying alike, a
mechanism moving no status, a requirement never above its worst claim, every reader
agreeing on one, *ready* staying the claims', the requirement record), `gap` now
resolving as `status` does in each records sweep's gap rows (~2 s), and `gap` and
`why R1` in the vocabulary world (~0.5 s). What it paid (~4.2 s):
`test_status_table.UnqualifiedReadsGap` (3.5 s; not an invariant class, the composition
it reads held in process by UnqualifiedBesideAPassIsNeverChecked and StatusTable) and
`test_renderers.BlockingTagIsStatusTag`'s `check` run (0.7 s) to the full suite. Still
at the line, not under it: the next change that adds pays first. The review of phase 1
added six in-process rows (~0.03 s: a requirement over a disagreeing claim, the capped
requirements line, the requirement-claim id collision) and measured flat: 89.4 s and
89.5 s wall for its 775 tests against 89.3 s and 92.2 s for b67e135's 769, interleaved
in one session on 2026-10-14 (load average 1.2-1.5). The review of
P2.5b added eight rows (the in-process halves of its laundering paths, ~0.3 s;
its end-to-end rows are left to the gate, below) and measured flat: 93.6 s wall
(67 s user) for 746 tests against 93.6 s for 7e71aac's 738 in the same session,
2026-10-04 — still over, so the rule below stands. P2.5b is OVER
it, said here rather than hidden: measured 2026-10-04 within the hour (load
average 0.7-1.3), 93.4 s wall (67.8 s user) for 738 tests, against 88.3 s wall
(63.6 s user) for `ecaad99`'s 713 on the same machine. What it added (~13 s,
measured test by test with --durations): invariant 12's in-process rows and
the in-process halves of 7, 8 and 11 over an exported article (~3 s, each with
its planted violator); four rows in each records sweep — `export`, its JSON,
its dry run, `report --milestone` (+3.8 s; kept, as every row of those sweeps
is: a command that writes is what they exist to catch); the export channel in
the vocabulary world and the imports of two more test modules. What it paid
back (~8 s): `claim list --status` reads a bracket copy of its own instead of
building that world (-4.7 s, same assertions); the forged export's end-to-end
row (re-run filed, read back through `status`) and the one-time migration's
index row left to the gate, named below; the Fig. 4 and bracket export rows
here run `check` and `export` in process. The remaining ~3.5 s stands: the
next change that touches the fast tier pays it back first. Before it, the review of
P2.5a added fifteen in-process rows (~2 s: its laundering paths, each with its
planted violator) and moved nothing out: measured 2026-10-04, 86.7 s wall (62.3 s
user) for 713 tests — under the budget, so the next change that adds pays for
itself. P2.5a paid back
what P2.3 left over it, as its rule required: measured 2026-10-04, 83.7 s wall
(59.9 s user, load average 0.9) for 698 tests, against 107.2 s wall (79.5 s
user) for d23ff8e's 710 the same morning. What P2.5a added: its invariant
classes' in-process rows (~1.5 s: the channel table, the sealed file's
tamperings, the judge's facts, a fail across every edit, an authority's rows,
the checked section, the article moved by a nudge, the AST scans) and one pty
row (~0.9 s). What it moved out, each named in LEFT_FOR_THE_GATE or below with
its reason (~30 s): invariant 2's planted project (test_louder.ErrorIsLouder's
command rows) with test_json_keys, which reads the same project; S-05/S-07 and
S-20/S-21/S-32 through the CLI; P2.1's owner projects; UnqualifiedBesideAPass's
end-to-end project; StatusLinesSpeakTheTable's three projects — each the
commands half of a rule an in-process row here still holds. The records sweeps
and the bundled seal tests stay, as below. Before it, P2.3 was OVER the budget,
said here rather than hidden. The review of P2.4 added what it cost and
measured no move: two units scans in FAST (0.03 s), ten in-process tests in
AGoalpostIsNeverAKey, which runs whole (~0.6 s), and goalpost runs at four
scales where there were two — measured 2026-10-04 within the hour: 104.8 s wall
(79.1 s user) for 710 tests against 31b84a0's 106.2 s (78.0 s user) for 698
(load average 0.2-2.5). Flat, and still over 90 s; nothing was paid back: the
slowest entries (`--durations`) are the records sweeps and the bundled seal
tests, which this file keeps by choice (below), so the rule stands for the next
change. P2.4 paid back what it added and no
more: 104.7 s wall (79.0 s user) for 697 tests, against 104.9 s (77.6 s user)
for `f2d4754`'s list (660 tests) on the same machine within the same four minutes (load
average 0.3-1.9), measured 2026-10-03 — 107.1 s wall (80.6 s user) before the
pay-back. What P2.4 added: its in-process classes (~0.7 s: a pass held to the
goalpost it read, the comparison in `compose`, the breach rule and its mark,
the malformed contexts refused) and the goalpost runs in every control of a
gate that reads one — two more known-good runs of `bracket.deflection` per
control run, in every CLI test that runs the bracket's controls (+1.5-2 s
spread). Moved out to pay it: test_status_table's three bracket copies of
their own (~2.5 s; named below, with the rule each reads and where it runs in
process). Still over 90 s, so the rule stands: the next change that touches the
fast tier pays the rest back first. The review of P2.3 added its laundering
paths' in-process tests (~2 s: the PACK_DIR line, a known-good-only file and tier
read, a held known-bad pass, the words of an unusable control,
TheCheckRunTakesTheQualifiedPath) and pack mode and JUnit to
QualificationWordsComeFromOneTable's scan (~1 s): 104 s before it, 104-109 s after
over two runs, measured 2026-10-03 within the hour (load average 1.0-1.7; 77 s
user). Before: 101 s measured 2026-10-03 (load average
1.1-1.5; 74 s user) against 90 s for the P2.2 list on the same machine within
the hour (65 s user). What crossed, measured test by test: P2.3's own classes
(~4 s: QualificationIsPaired's in-process cases, the walk's cases, V3, V4, V8)
and qualification's cost in every CLI test that runs a control — a known-good
half and a walk beside each known-bad one — spread at 0.2-0.9 s over some
thirty tests (+6 s). Moved out, named in LEFT_FOR_THE_GATE with their reasons:
the walk judged on real evaluators and the tripwire's scan (~19 s), the
600-key budget case (9.5 s), the early-cutoff and walk-keying cases (2.4 s),
inconclusive across the channels (0.9 s), S-25's bulk readers (2.2 s), and V11
and C12 to the full suite; and the walk's module-closure scan is now made once
per walk (`modelio.closure_scope`: 4.2 -> 1.7 s on the first 60-gate sweep).
Not moved, though each would fit the budget: the records sweeps and the bundled
seal tests — each carries a "what got through without it" above, and a tier
that drops a guard against a slip it once missed to meet a clock is the trade
this file refuses; the next change that touches the fast tier pays this back
first. Before: 89 s measured
2026-10-03 (load average 0.8-1.5; 64 s user) after the review of P2.2 grew
AnErroredPrerequisiteStaysLouder (+1.2 s: the dependent's own skip and refusal
behind a crashed guard, and the ranking within Skipped) and added
ApplyingTheRuleTwiceMovesNothing (0.2 s) — one second under, so the next test
that joins moves one out; 87.5 s measured
2026-10-03 (load average 1.4-1.8; 64 s user) after P2.2 added invariant 10's
classes and its fast neighbours (~3 s, in process), with the matrix, the
transcript and the wrapped-beam cases left to the full suite (below) — at the
budget, so the next class that joins moves one out; 87 s measured
2026-10-03 (load average 1.9-2.3, the quietest this machine got that day; 59 s
user) after P2.1 added four `test_vocabulary` classes, `test_json_keys` and
`test_owner` (the sentence-branch scan 4.3 s, `claim physical` end to end 3.3 s
the slowest) and left V15's seven bracket copies to the full suite — near the
budget, so the next class that joins pays for itself or moves one out; 70-74 s
measured 2026-10-03 (load average 0.8-1.4) after the P2.0 review grew
``test_louder``, ``test_status_table`` (an end-to-end project) and
``test_mutation`` to 4.8 s, 2.7 s and 2.3 s alone, and 85 s for the same list
with other agents loading the machine (load average 1.6-4.3); 66-72 s (load
average 0.1-2.5) when those three joined at 5.0 s, 0.1 s and 1.0 s; 68-71 s
before them (load average 1.3), after the bundled-pack seal
tests and the migrated-project write sweep joined; 54-59 s before those, and
94 s for that shorter list with other agents loading the machine. Re-time it
whenever ``FAST`` changes; a run under load is not a measurement.

**The selection is an explicit list of test names.** Rejected:

* a timing threshold ("everything under 2 s") — the cut moves with the machine,
  and a slower runner silently drops an invariant test from the tier;
* a ``@slow`` mark on the tests left out — forty files edited, and a test marked
  slow by mistake leaves its invariant unguarded with nothing turning red;
* ``discover -p`` patterns — they select modules, and the invariant modules are
  the slow ones; the violation tests inside them are what this tier needs.

Two things keep the list honest:

* a name that no longer resolves is an ERROR, never a silent drop (unittest
  turns it into a failing test), so renaming a listed test turns this tier red;
* ``FastTierHoldsEveryInvariant`` holds the list to ``test_meta``'s map of
  CLAUDE.md's numbered invariants: every invariant class has at least one test
  here, and every test of such a class is in ``FAST`` or ``LEFT_FOR_THE_GATE``.
  A test added to an invariant class, or the class that carries a new
  invariant, turns this tier red until someone decides where it runs and says
  why. Its planted violators show it refusing each of those.

**When the fast tier is not enough.** Before it hands off, an iteration runs
whole the modules that guard what it touched — the CLI scenarios and sweeps left
out below are the channels that code carries:

* what a gate's read set records or how a verdict or a control is keyed (the
  tracer, `sweep` and `admission` in `verdicts.py`; fixture and control loading
  in `gates.py`; the recording loader in `modelio.py`; `FileDigests` in
  `util.py`) -> `test_admission`, `test_staleness`, `test_cache`,
  `test_check_cache` and `test_gate_context`;
* the qualification — `gates.mutation_walk`, `verdicts._run_control`,
  `_qualification` and the strict reader of a control entry (P2.3) ->
  `test_admission` and `test_mutation` whole, and `test_packs`;
* a command's code in `cli.py`, `store.py`, a record writer or a migration ->
  `test_records` (every command on a legacy project, and the shims);
* a pack's fixtures or baseline, the fixture context in `gates.py`, or
  `NegativeControl` -> `test_packs` (with `test_pack_mode`);
* the prerequisite rule — `gates.plan`/`prerequisite_root`/`run_all`,
  `verdicts.apply_prerequisites`/`_pruned_row`, `cli._swept`, `claims.compose`'s
  rung 2 — -> `test_prerequisites` whole (its matrix and transcript are left out
  below) and `test_packs.ControlsAreIsolated`;
* a renderer's code — `report.py`, `Verdict.render`, `cmd_check`,
  `cmd_status`, `cmd_doctor`, `claim list`/`show`, `decisions.why`,
  `site.state` or the site template — -> `test_louder` is in this tier; also
  run `test_renderers`, `test_junit`, `test_shapes` and `test_site` whole;
* the site — its template, `site.py`, `page.py`, `prose.py` or `graph.py`
  (architecture phase 5) -> `test_map`, `test_site_truth` and `test_style`
  whole, and `test_site`;
* a goalpost or an operating context (P2.4) — `GateContext.acceptance`,
  `gates._held_to_acceptances`/`_held_to_context`/`context_breach`/
  `goalpost_runs`, `verdicts._contexted` and the `acceptance:` ledger keys,
  `claims.cross_check`/`margin` and `compose`'s rungs 1, 3 and 7, a pack's
  `comparator=` — -> `test_goalposts` and `test_context` whole (their bracket
  copies run through the commands are left out below), and `test_packs` for a
  pack's.

#   requires its gates to go stale. StaleIsNotCurrent above holds the same lie on
#   synthetic gates; on the bundled content it is the escalation rule (module
#   docstring: tracer and keying code runs test_staleness whole) and the full
#   suite that catch it.
#   test_records' EveryReaderMigratesAsCheckDoes and
#   EvidenceNeverSitsWhereARecordGoes 20, and the rest of LegacyLedgerMigrates,
#   RecordWriter, InitIsTheNewLayout, SaveWritesTheLayoutItFinds 3: the one-time
#   migration of a legacy project and the record writer's bytes.
#   The cache and the traced gate world: gate_context 30, check_cache 24,
#   cache 13, spine_digest 3, bracket_cache 2, fdm_memo 2. Keying machinery: the
#   iteration that touches it runs these with test_admission and test_staleness
#   (module docstring); the lie they guard against is StaleIsNotCurrent's, whose
#   in-process scenarios are above.
#   test_prerequisites' project-per-case classes 25 (P2.2): the §3 matrix,
#   54 projects (PrunedRowIsWhatStatusReads); the bracket at arm 30 through
#   `check` and JUnit (BracketGuardTranscript); the wrapped beam at two designs
#   (GuardsReachNarrowClaims); `check --only` expanding (PlanIsStable's CLI
#   test); the words, `doctor` included (PrerequisiteWords); the corpus resolved
#   with and without the rule (ResolveIsUnchangedWithoutNeeds); the cad mesh
#   guards (trimesh), the bracket header, JUnit's skip and `selftest --only`.
#   The rule they hold is the one FAST runs in process; a change to the sweep,
#   the resolver or `cli._swept` runs test_prerequisites whole. And
#   test_packs.ControlsAreIsolated 6: every bundled edge's isolation and the
#   planted pairs, which `pack validate` also checks; and
#   test_packs.AGuardFailureNeverHidesAnIndependentFail 1: an over-broad guard
#   (the review of P2.2's three sourcing edges), which isolation cannot see.
#   test_vocabulary.ReadyMeansEveryRequiredClaimChecked ~25: V15 through the
#   commands — what `check`, `status`, their JSON, JUnit and the page say about
#   *ready* on seven bracket copies; `ReadyIsThePredicate` holds the predicate
#   they all read, in process, every iteration.
#   The command and document surfaces: shapes 26, param_view 25, site 21,
#   pack_mode 20, record_commands 19, doctor 19, shims 15, status_stale 13,
#   fixture_hygiene 10, contracts 9, openmodelica_build 8, junit_cli 4, vcs 2,
#   ci_config 1, docs_commands 1, pack_keys 0.5, project_marker 0.4: what a
#   command prints, writes or documents, and the bracket's own controls.
