"""pcb-kicad's reader for KiCad's own files, and the one formula it cites.

Standard library only, so the tier-0 gates run where KiCad is not installed (CI
among them) and every file they decide on is opened by Python, where the trace
sees it. ``kicad-cli`` reads its files in a subprocess the trace cannot see into,
which is why the gates that drive it are opaque and re-run on every check.

**The format.** ``.kicad_pcb``, ``.kicad_sch`` and ``.kicad_sym`` are KiCad's
S-expression files (dev-docs.kicad.org, "File Formats"): a list is ``(head
item...)``, an item is a list, a quoted string or a bare atom. :func:`parse`
keeps quoted strings apart from atoms (:class:`Q`) so :func:`dump` writes back a
file KiCad reads the same way: the known-bad fixtures are the baseline board with
one thing changed, written by this module at fixture time.

**What the board model keeps.** Only what a tier-0 gate decides on: the net table,
each footprint's reference and pads (number, net, the library pin name KiCad
calls ``pinfunction``, the pin type), and each copper track's net, width, layer
and length. Zones are counted, not modelled: a net carried by a pour as well as
by tracks is reported as such, never judged on the pour.

**The formula.** :func:`temp_rise_c` is IPC-2221's trace-heating curve fit,
cited in ``references/ipc-2221.md`` with the range it was fitted over.
