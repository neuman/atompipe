"""pcb-kicad — gates for a printed circuit board drawn in KiCad.

    pcb.board_readable   tier 0  the board is a KiCad file this reader knows (the guard)
    pcb.pin_names        tier 0  pins the library gives one name carry one net
    pcb.net_width        tier 0  every track of each current-carrying net, IPC-2221
    pcb.drc              tier 1  KiCad's design rule check, every severity
    pcb.unconnected      tier 1  KiCad's count of connections the copper never makes
    pcb.erc              tier 1  KiCad's electrical rules check of the schematic
    pcb.parity           tier 1  KiCad's comparison of the board with its schematic
    pcb.fab_rules        tier 1  KiCad's DRC with a fab's published minimums as its rules
    pcb.spice            tier 1  one .meas of ngspice on the project's deck, against a band
    pcb.enclosure_fit    tier 1  the populated board's 3D models against the enclosure

**Where each verdict comes from.** The tier-1 gates are a tool's own answer:
``kicad-cli pcb drc``'s or ``sch erc``'s exit code and its report's count (basis
established; ``pcb.fab_rules`` sourced, for the fab's numbers it hands KiCad),
ngspice's ``.meas`` value, OpenCascade's shared volume and distance, each on a copy
staged under the gate's out directory. They read inside a subprocess the trace
cannot see into, so they are opaque and re-run on every check where their tool
exists, as openmodelica's ``omc`` gates do. The tier-0 gates read
the board with the pack's own reader (``_kicad.py``), so they run where KiCad is not
installed and every file they decide on is keyed. ``pcb.pin_names`` judges against
the library's pin names that KiCad copied onto the board from the schematic, and
``pcb.net_width`` against IPC-2221's heating curve: both sourced.

**What slipped through, and which gate it is for** (from an autonomous board
pipeline this pack was extracted from; references/what-slipped-through.md):

- ``pcb.drc``: every gate in that pipeline ran at error severity, so a warning could
  never fail it. The pin-1 warning on a ribbon connector was 21.4 mm of silk on an
  8 mm strip, and its fab would have clipped it. This gate runs every severity, and
  a waiver is KiCad's own exclusion, recorded in the project file.
- ``pcb.drc``, ``pcb.unconnected``: the fab export there ignored kicad-cli's exit code
  and read a report file another script also wrote, so a failed run could pass on a
  stale one. These read the exit code and the report this run wrote, and a
  disagreement between the two is an error.
- ``pcb.net_width``: a power width was set in code that never reached the board, and
  the battery path shipped at 0.2 mm for weeks of "0 violations, 0 unconnected". No
  rule check can see a width nobody asked for.
- ``pcb.pin_names``: an ESD array's flow-through pins were wired D+ to pin 1 and D- to
  pin 6, which the part joins inside. The copper was legal; a person reading the
  datasheet found it.
- ``pcb.enclosure_fit``: a joystick routed onto both boards stood 6 mm proud of the
  face, found by a person on sight. And kicad-cli's STEP export drops a part whose
  3D model it cannot find, with exit 0: a part the fit cannot see is a skip here.

**Missing inputs skip; they never default.** Which board, which nets carry how much
current, how hot a trace may run, which fab, which deck and limit, which enclosure
and where the board sits in it are the project's to say.

    track width and spacing, via and plated-hole drills, via pad, annular ring,

    ``pcb_fab`` names the fab: ``jlcpcb`` (``gates/fab/jlcpcb.json``, each number
    quoted from the fab's capability page with the day it was read), or a path,
    from the project root, to a file of the same shape. The row is picked by the
    board's copper layer count and ``pcb_copper_oz_outer``. The rules are written
    as the staged board's ``.kicad_dru`` and the staged project's own minimums are
    zeroed (its minimum clearance set to the fab's), so a finding of a
    constrained type is the fab's, except silk on silk: KiCad reports it as
    ``silk_overlap`` too, the type the fab's silk-to-pad rule raises, and it is
    ``pcb.drc``'s (``_kicad.fab_findings``; where the board's pads cannot be told
    apart, every silk overlap is counted here). Every other finding in the run
    (silk clipped by the mask, an unconnected item) is ``pcb.drc``'s, judged there
    under the project's own severities, not here; one of a type the project
    ignores is said apart, since ``pcb.drc`` does not see it. The project's own
    custom rules do not apply in this run (and where it has some, the rest are
    said to be not the fab's, since a rule of its own may waive them in
    ``pcb.drc``), a constrained type it set to "ignore" is raised to "error", and a
    local clearance override below the fab's clearance is held at it: one written
    to relax a constraint must not relax the fab. An override above the fab's
    clearance still binds and fails copper inside it (GitHub #13).
