"""Known-bad fixtures for pcb-kicad. One change each, to the baseline board or to
its schematic.

`nopekit gate selftest` requires every gate to FAIL here. A gate that passes its
own fixture is broken, and a green verdict from it means nothing.

**Sealed.** Every fixture starts from this pack's own ``selftest/baseline.json``
and ``selftest/assets/esd_guard.*``, never from the host's projection or the
host's board, and hands the gate an empty ledger. A control whose severity
depended on the host's board would fire in some projects and not in others.

**Generated, from the limit the gate judges by.** Each bad project is the baseline
board or schematic parsed by the pack's own reader, one thing changed, and written
back under the CALLER's ``out_dir`` (``<out_dir>/pcb-kicad/known-bad/<fixture>/``),
with the baseline's other files beside it so KiCad applies the same rules. Never into this
directory: a fixture that writes into the pack it is proving makes the proof
depend on whether the pack is writable. ``narrow_power`` derives its width from
the baseline's own rise limit and current with the gate's own formula, so lifting
the limit cannot quietly turn the control into a pass.
