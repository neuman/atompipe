"""Known-bad geometry for the mesh gates. One defect each, in the gate's direction.

Every fixture returns ``{"meshes": {...}}``, which the selftest machinery merges
into ``ctx.extra``; the gates look there before the projection, so the gate under
test runs on this geometry and the project's own parts are left alone.

The discipline that makes these worth anything: each function starts from a CLEAN
box and changes exactly one physically meaningful thing, in the direction the gate
under test claims to detect. A corrupt file or an empty mesh would prove the gates
handle garbage — which is not the claim any of them makes.

trimesh is imported inside each function, never at module level. Two reasons: the
selftest machinery declines to load a fixture at all when the gate's tooling is
missing, and a module-level import would make this file unreadable on the very
machine where the honest answer is SKIPPED.

Two kinds of fixture live here, and the second kind is newer. Most are known-BAD:
the unittest harness runs them and requires the gate to fail. ``coplanar_touch_pair``
is the other direction — geometry the gate must come out CLEAR on, with no allowlist
entry — because ``cad.clash`` had a false positive (a bulkhead and a deck sharing one
face reported as 31277.200 mm^3) and a gate hardened against a false positive can
lose its true negatives quietly. The harness has no way to require a pass, so
``selftest/check_clash_contact.py`` runs the whole matrix and is the thing to run
after touching that gate.

Where a fixture necessarily trips a second gate as well, its docstring says so.
``sliver_pair`` duplicates one corner of a closed box and repoints a subset of the
faces meeting there, which is what a tessellator does when it emits a rim vertex
twice: the surface stays geometrically closed and goes topologically open, so
``cad.watertight`` fails it as well. That is not a side effect to apologise for, it
is the same defect seen by the other gate — but what the control has to show is that
the gate under test trips for the reason the fixture planted, which for
``cad.degenerate_faces`` is the repair count.

    This is the defect PACK.md names, planted on the box rather than beside it: a

    of the faces that meet there is repointed at the copy, and one face spans the
    two. One physical change, two consequences, both of which this gate is the one
    that sees:

    * **adjacency splits.** The faces on either side of the duplicated corner are
      no longer neighbours even though they touch everywhere, so the surface is
      topologically open where it is geometrically closed — every algorithm that
      walks adjacency (offset, slicing, thickness, boolean) now works across a seam.
      The two copies weld back together at 1e-4 mm: one repair.
    * **a sliver appears only after the weld.** The face spanning the two copies has
      an area of 0.5 * 1e-6 mm * 20 mm = 1e-5 mm^2 — about a thousand times the
      1e-8 mm^2 zero-area threshold, so it survives an area test comfortably. Weld
      the corner and its two ends become one point and its area is exactly zero.
      A drop-then-weld implementation finds nothing here and reports a clean part;
      weld-then-drop finds it. That ordering is what this fixture exists to prove.

    An earlier version of this fixture put the sliver at ``(BOX_MM, 0, 0)`` — 10 mm
    clear of a box spanning [-10, 10], floating in empty space. The gate detected
    it, but a disconnected triangle appended to a file is "added garbage", not the
    adjacency split the pack documents, and it proved nothing about a duplicated rim
    vertex on a closed surface. It is rebuilt on the geometry here so the claim and
    the evidence are the same statement.

    Also trips cad.watertight, and now genuinely for the documented reason: the
    repointed faces carry their edges to the copy, so those edges are used once
    instead of twice. Geometrically closed, topologically open. The measurement that

    VERTICES and it reads as 11.14 mm apart (nearest vertex to the other surface) or
    36.73 mm (nearest vertex pair): a tessellated cylinder has vertices only at its
    two end rings, 40 mm clear of the boss at either end, and the boss's own vertices
    are its eight corners, out at the block's edges. Nothing either solid stores as a
    point is anywhere near the place where they actually meet. A gate written that
    way would have reported the one correctly assembled joint on the boat as broken
    and passed the two that were not connected at all — exactly inverted, and
    confident. ``selftest/check_connectivity.py`` measures all three numbers and
    prints them side by side.

    Also: interpenetration is CONTACT here. This is the opposite question from
    `cad.clash`, asked about a different set of pairs, and the pair is declared in
    `clash_allow` as well — one list, read from both ends.
