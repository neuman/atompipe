"""Behaviour matrix for ``cad.clash``: touching, interfering, and bonded.

    python3 packs/cad-solid/selftest/check_clash_contact.py

The unittest harness can only require a gate to FAIL — that is what a negative
control is — so it exercises ``selftest/bad_meshes.py:overlapping_pair`` and
stops. Half of what this gate has to get right is the other direction: a pair
that TOUCHES must come out clear, and it must come out clear without anybody
writing an allowlist entry for it. A gate hardened against false negatives loses
that quietly, and the symptom is a page of red on a correctly built assembly,
which is the exact moment somebody reaches for a wildcard.

So the two halves are asserted together, here, on sealed fixtures:

1. **A coplanar face contact PASSES**, is recorded as ``contact`` rather than
   ``clear``, is never booleaned, and carries no reported volume. This is the
   defect that prompted the file: a bulkhead and a deck sharing one face exactly
   were reported as ``worst reported 31277.200 mm^3 ... inf mm equivalent depth
   over 0.00 mm^2``. Two solids can only share material inside the intersection of
   their bounding boxes; that box was degenerate, so the shared volume was exactly
   zero and every digit of the headline was kernel noise.
2. **A real interference still FAILS**, at the same 2 mm overlap, so (1) cannot
   have been bought by loosening anything.
3. **An interference declared BONDED still FAILS.** ``bonded_joints`` waives the
   volume tolerance and keeps the depth tolerance; a pair 2 mm into another part
   is 2 mm in whatever the declaration says.
4. **A bond-line-scale overlap PASSES when declared and FAILS when not.** Both
   halves are needed: without the second the declaration might be doing nothing,
   and a mechanism that does nothing is worse than none because people trust it.
5. **A wildcard, a missing reason, and a sliding pair are all REFUSED**, each
   failing the gate on the declaration rather than being honoured or dropped.

Exits non-zero and names every row that came out wrong. Standalone on purpose: it
is a check on the instrument, it needs no project, and it must be runnable on the
machine where the answer is bad.
