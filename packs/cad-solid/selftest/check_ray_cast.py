"""Agreement check for ``cad.wall_thickness``'s two ray casters.

    python3 packs/cad-solid/selftest/check_ray_cast.py

``cad.wall_thickness`` measures with whichever ray caster the machine can offer:
trimesh's accelerated engine when an ``rtree`` or ``embree`` binding is installed,
and otherwise the gate's own vectorised Moller-Trumbore fallback. Neither binding is
a dependency of trimesh, so **which path runs is a fact about the machine, not about
the model** — and a number that changes with the machine is not evidence. Three
things have to be true for that to be acceptable, and this script asserts all three
rather than leaving them as a claim in a docstring:

1. **Scale invariance.** The same shape, uniformly scaled over five orders of
   magnitude, must report the same wall (scaled). This is the check that would have
   caught the defect it was written for: the parallel-ray cutoff was
   ``1e-12 * mesh.scale**3``, a VOLUME compared against a determinant whose units
   are LENGTH^2 — so the cutoff grew as the cube of the part's overall span while
   the quantity it gated stayed fixed by facet size.

2. **Span independence.** A part measured on its own and the identical part measured
   as one member of a widely spread assembly must give the same wall. This is the
   sharp version of (1): the facets are byte-for-byte identical and only
   ``mesh.scale`` moves, so any difference is the cutoff reading the assembly's
   bounding diagonal instead of the triangle in front of it.

3. **Engine agreement**, where an accelerated engine is actually installed. Reported
   as NOT EXERCISED, never as a pass, when it is not — an untested equivalence is an
   assumption, and the whole point of this file is not to ship those.

Exits non-zero and names the drift. Deliberately standalone: it is a check on the
instrument, it needs no project, and it must be runnable on the machine where the
answer is bad.
