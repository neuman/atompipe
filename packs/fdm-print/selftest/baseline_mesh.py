"""The solid the pack's baseline projection describes, and the code that made it.

``selftest/baseline.json`` is a projection of a GOOD design: every gate in this
pack passes on it, which is what makes the known-bad fixtures in
``bad_params.py`` and ``bad_meshes.py`` meaningful — each one moves exactly one
thing and the gate under test flips to FAIL.

Five of the seven gates read scalars, and the JSON carries them. The other two —
``fdm.overhang`` and ``fdm.bridge_span`` — read triangles, and a JSON file cannot
hold triangles. So the projection points ``mesh_path`` at
``selftest/baseline_part.stl``, and this module is the source that generated it.
The STL is committed next to it so the gates can run with nothing else present;
re-running this module reproduces it byte-for-byte from the numbers below.

The part
--------
A conduit saddle clamp. An inverted-U body straddles a 30 mm conduit and is
through-bolted to a panel by two outward feet; the feet are drilled on assembly,
which is why the printed body carries no holes (see ``references/geometry_rules.md``
on printed hole sizes). It is printed the way it is used: feet on the bed, the
opening arching over the conduit, so the bolt feet are solid against the plate and
the outer faces come off the machine as walls rather than as stepped overhangs.

The cross-section is constant along the conduit, so the solid is a prism: one
closed outline in the (x, z) plane extruded along +y. That is not a modelling
shortcut, it is the design — a constant section is what makes the part printable
in this orientation at all.

Why it passes each mesh gate, by construction:

* **Overhang.** The only downward-facing surfaces that are not on the bed are the
  two chamfers at the top corners of the opening, at
  ``atan(CHAMFER_RUN_MM / CHAMFER_RISE_MM)`` = 39.8 deg from vertical. That is
  inside the 45 deg limit with room to spare, and it is the textbook move: a
  chamfer instead of support.
* **Bridge span.** Those chamfers also cut the flat ceiling down to
  ``OPENING_W_MM - 2 * CHAMFER_RUN_MM`` = 18 mm, which is inside the 30 mm
  bridgeable maximum and inside the 20 mm below which a bridge is reliably flat.
  The ceiling is anchored on both chamfers, so it is a real bridge and not a
  ceiling hanging off nothing.

``trimesh`` and ``numpy`` are imported inside the functions, like the rest of the
pack's mesh code, so this file can be read on a machine without them.
