"""Known-bad meshes for the tier-1 printability gates.

Each fixture writes a small solid to the run's output directory and returns a
context whose ``mesh_path`` points at it. Everything else in the projection is
left alone, so a failing verdict can only be about the geometry that changed.

The solids are generated rather than checked in for two reasons. They stay
parametric — the arch's gap is written as a number next to the limit it has to
beat, so a project that raises ``max_bridge_mm`` does not silently turn its own
negative control into a passing fixture. And they stay honest about what is wrong
with them: each one is watertight, sits on the bed, and fits any reasonable build
volume. The only thing wrong is the thing the gate under test measures.

``trimesh`` and ``numpy`` are imported here, not at module scope, so this file can
be read and imported on a machine without them. The spine only calls a fixture
after ``availability()`` has confirmed the gate's dependencies exist.

    something is hanging in space; that is the harder case and the one worth
    controlling for.

    The gap is read against the limit the gate will actually enforce — the
    baseline's ``max_bridge_mm``, the same projection the fixture is staged
    against — so the fixture cannot be quietly neutralised by raising the limit:
    it is always three times whatever the gate is being asked to enforce. (It read
    ``ctx.param`` for that number before, which took it from the host project
    while the rest of the projection came from the baseline: two different
    machines describing one fixture.)

    has to be honest about the whole set. The arch is the second of three parts,
    between two copies of the good baseline clamp, so a fold that reported the
    first part, the last part, or an average would report a clamp at roughly 0.6
    of its allowance and PASS — while a genuine 90 mm bridge sat on the plate.
    That is the failure worth controlling for here, and it is invisible to any
    fixture holding a single part.

    ``steep_cone`` deliberately stays a single part, so between the two of them
    both paths are proven to be able to fail. ``fdm_print_fold.fold`` is one
    function shared by every multi-part gate in this pack, so this fixture is
    what stands behind ``fdm.overhang``'s and ``fdm.bed_fit``'s set mode too —
