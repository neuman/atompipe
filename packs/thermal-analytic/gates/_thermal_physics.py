"""Closed-form heat-transfer arithmetic, with no opinions about design limits.

Everything here is a function of numbers only: no GateContext, no Verdict, no
registry. The gates in ``thermal.py`` do the reading, the comparing and the
reporting; this file does the physics. Keeping the split means a wrong number can
be reproduced in three lines at a REPL, and it means the property tables and the
correlation validity bands live in exactly one place (rule 2).

Units, without exception:

    length  m          temperature  K inside, degC only at the boundary
    area    m^2        conductivity k  W/(m*K)
    volume  m^3        coefficient  h  W/(m^2*K)
    power   W          resistance   K/W   (absolute)  or  m^2*K/W  (per area)
    time    s          density      kg/m^3      cp  J/(kg*K)

Two rules this module follows and the gates depend on:

1. **Every correlation states its validated range and reports whether it was
   honoured.** A Nusselt number computed outside the band the correlation was
   fitted in is a number, not a measurement, and the caller has to be able to
   tell the difference.
2. **Nothing here silently clamps.** Property lookups outside the table say so;
   they do not extrapolate and keep quiet about it.
