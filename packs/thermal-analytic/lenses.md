# Adversarial lenses — thermal

Run these before anything is built, and run them against the *design case the
model does not contain*. Every heading below has ended a real project's week.
Each question is meant to be answerable with a number, not a shrug.

---

## Worst-case ambient

The ambient in the model is almost never the ambient in service.

- What is the air temperature **inside** the enclosure after an hour at full load
  with the lid on? Not the room — the room is where you measured, not where the
  part lives. A sealed box routinely sits 15-25 K above room air.
- What is the ambient on the hottest day this will ever see, in the position it
  will be installed — on a roof, against a south wall, in a vehicle in the sun,
  in a rack behind another machine's exhaust?
- If it is outdoors, is the **sky** temperature being used for radiation rather
  than the air temperature? On a clear night the effective sky is 15-25 K below
  air, and that is a radiator's best friend and a frost's cause.
- Does anything derate with temperature — a battery, a fan bearing, an
  electrolytic capacitor, an adhesive? At what ambient does the derating curve
  start, and is that inside your design window?
- Altitude: air density falls, so forced convection falls with it. Was the fan
  sized at sea level for a product that ships to 2000 m?

## Stagnation, and the day the flow stops

The design case everybody forgets is the one with no flow on a sunny day.

- **What temperature does the absorber reach with the pump off and full sun?** It
  is `T_amb + tau_alpha*G/U_L`, it does not depend on area or flow rate, and it
  gets *worse* the better you insulate. What survives it: the seals, the glazing
  gasket, the absorber coating, the heat transfer fluid, the pipe insulation, the
  sensor?
- Glycol degrades irreversibly above roughly 120-140 degC and turns acidic. Does
  your stagnation temperature exceed that, and if so what is the plan — a dump
  load, a drain-back, a cover, an accepted fluid change interval?
- Steam. If the fluid flashes, where does it go, what pressure does the loop see,
  and is the expansion vessel sized for vapour rather than for thermal expansion
  of liquid?
- The same question outside solar: what happens when the **fan stops**? Not "does
  it alarm" — what is the steady temperature with h reduced to the natural
  convection value, and how long does it take to get there? That second number is
  your time constant, and it decides whether a shutdown is fast enough to matter.
- What happens when the flow is merely *reduced* — a partly blocked filter, a
  fouled pipe, a fan at half speed on a quiet-mode setting nobody told you about?

## Thermal expansion at the joints

Heat gets into structure through fasteners and bonds.

- Over the full temperature range, how much does each member grow, and what
  restrains it? Aluminium against steel is roughly 12 um/m/K of differential;
  aluminium against a polymer can be 100.
- Across a bonded or bolted joint of length L with a differential expansion
  `dalpha*dT*L`, what shear does the adhesive or the fastener see? Is the joint
  slotted, or is it going to do the yielding for you?
- Glazing in a frame: is there room for the pane to grow, at both ends, at the
  highest temperature the frame will ever see — including stagnation, not just
  operation?
- Copper pipe in a long run grows about 1.7 mm per metre per 100 K. Where is the
  expansion loop, and is it somewhere a fitter will actually leave it?
- Does anything clamp a thermal interface? A TIM's resistance is a function of
  pressure, and the pressure changes with temperature as the stack expands.

## Freeze protection

The cheapest failure and the most total.

- What is the lowest temperature any wetted part will ever see, including the
  outdoor run, the roof penetration, and the bit inside the wall near a vent?
- If the answer is below zero: glycol, drain-back, or trace heating? Each has a
  cost the model does not carry — glycol cuts specific heat and raises viscosity
  (so the pump, the heat exchanger and the collector output all change), drain-back
  constrains the entire pipe geometry to a continuous fall, trace heating fails
  when the power does.
- A freeze event usually happens during a **power cut**, which is exactly when
  the pump and the trace heating are off. Does the protection survive losing
  power, or does it depend on it?
- Water expands about 9% on freezing and it does not care about your pipe's
  pressure rating.

## Coating and surface degradation

Every optical and radiative number in the model is a new-condition number.

- A selective absorber coating that starts at alpha 0.95 / eps 0.05 does not stay
  there. UV, heat cycling and humidity all move emissivity **up**, which raises
  loss and lowers output. What does the model assume at end of life, and what
  does the warranty assume?
- Glazing transmittance falls with soiling, and soiling depends on the tilt and
  the site. A shallow tilt does not self-clean in the rain. What is the cleaning
  interval and who does it?
- Black anodising on a heatsink is worth having for radiation and is worth
  nothing if the part is inside a metal box that sees itself: check the view
  factor before paying for the finish.
- Dust on a heatsink is an insulating layer and a flow restriction at once. How
  much fin pitch closes up in a year in this environment, and is the pitch
  serviceable?
- Does anything outgas onto an optical surface at stagnation temperature?

## What happens when the pump stops

Give this its own review even though it overlaps the others, because it is a
sequence rather than a state.

- Trace the whole sequence: flow stops -> absorber climbs -> fluid expands ->
  fluid boils -> vapour displaces liquid -> the loop cools -> liquid returns onto
  a surface that is still hot. Which component sees the worst condition, and at
  which step?
- What tells the controller the pump stopped? A relay it commanded is not a flow
  measurement. If the sensor is in the wrong place it reports a temperature
  nobody cares about and the control loop is decorative.
- On restart, cold fluid hits a very hot absorber. Thermal shock on a glazed
  plate, and possibly a steam hammer in the pipework. Is the restart delayed
  until the plate has cooled?
- Is there a path for heat to go *backwards* overnight — a thermosiphon running
  the collector as a radiator and emptying the store into the sky? Where is the
  check valve, and is it the kind that actually closes at these flow rates?

## Transient and startup

- The model is steady state. How long does the design take to *get* there, and is
  anything worse on the way? A cold-start inrush, a fan that spins up late, a
  heater at full duty before the sensor has caught up.
- Is the sensor's own time constant comparable with the thing it is measuring? A
  probe in a thermowell can lag by minutes, and a controller tuned against a lag
  it does not know about will oscillate.
- What is the duty cycle? A part that is over its steady limit but only runs for
  a quarter of a time constant may be fine — and that argument is only valid if
  the Biot number says the body has one temperature.

## Sensor and control placement

- Where is the limit actually defined — junction, case, surface, air? The
  datasheet limit and the place you can physically measure are rarely the same
  point, and the difference is a resistance you must write down.
- Is the sensor measuring the hot spot or the average? The average is comforting
  and the hot spot is what fails.
- If the sensor falls off, opens, or shorts, what does the control do? "Full
  power" is a common and expensive default.
