## What Is Nopekit?

**Nopekit gives your AI agent engineering checks that can say “nope.”** It's a plugin for Claude Code, Codex and Cursor that helps you turn an idea into a physical design, test it against math, physics and engineering tools, and see what still needs work.

It's based on the [Grounding by Falsification](https://github.com/neuman/nopekit/blob/main/grounding_by_falsification.pdf) approach. AI has gotten very good at making believable proposals for all sorts of things both digital and physical but it is especially good at coding. The problem is that it's still not great at figuring out which proposals are actually good on its own. Grounding by falsification is the idea that we need to wrap AI with something outside itself that can check its work and say "nope" using trusted reasoning/math/physics/etc. Nopekit turns that approach into an extensible framework with room for plugins that can falsify proposals across any domain but especially physical design work.

**You describe what you want. The agent proposes a design. Independent checks try to break it.** Nopekit records the results and the reasons behind each design choice, then shows them on a project site. When the design changes, affected results become stale until checked again. Assumptions and tests that need a real prototype stay visible.

For example: “This shelf must carry 10 kg” becomes a load and a deflection limit. The agent designs a bracket; a beam check rejects it if it sags too far; a printability check rejects walls that are too thin. You can follow what failed, what changed, and why the next candidate is better.

## See It In Action

**[PETGasus](https://neuman.github.io/PETGasusDrone/) is a quadcopter with a frame designed to print in one piece.** Its project site connects the design you can see with the requirements, decisions and evidence behind it.

[![PETGasus project site showing the drone and its grounding map](docs/img/site-example.png)](https://neuman.github.io/PETGasusDrone/)

[**Explore the live site →**](https://neuman.github.io/PETGasusDrone/) · [**Read the project repository →**](https://github.com/neuman/petgasusdrone)

The design history includes disconnected frames, thin walls and a frame that sagged far more than its optimizer predicted. Those rejected candidates are part of the record. The site shows what passed, what failed and what still waits on a physical build.

For smaller starting points, explore the [bracket example](examples/bracket/README.md), which runs without extra dependencies, or the [motorcycle airflow example](examples/motorbike/README.md), which uses OpenFOAM and ParaView.

## Built In Packs

Packs give the agent tools for a domain. A **proposer** makes a candidate; a **falsifier**, called a **gate**, checks it. One design can use several packs: a drone frame needs structural, printing, geometry and cost checks.

**Falsifiers**

These eleven packs ship with Nopekit. The images show designs, results or illustrations of what each pack can check; click a pack name for its gates, sources, setup and limits.

Offline; no live stock search. No extra dependencies. |

**How much should you trust a check?** Each gate declares where its logic comes from:

- **Established:** an existing tool's own verdict, such as KiCad's design-rule check. Trust extends as far as that tool and the problem you gave it.
- **Sourced:** a formula or rule from a cited textbook, standard or datasheet. Trust depends on the source and its range of applicability.
- **Model-only:** logic without an independent source. Its controls show it can fail; they do not establish that its reasoning is correct.

Before a gate's passes count, it must pass a known-good input and reject a known-bad one. That qualification is separate from its basis. **Skipped, crashed and stale checks never count as passes.** The report shows both the outcome and the basis so you can judge the evidence.

**Proposers**

The agent itself is the everyday proposer, writing and changing your design. Built-in packs also ship dedicated proposal tools:

| Example | Proposer | Tool and trust |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="docs/img/combos/topology-field-proposal.png" width="360" alt="Top and side views of the SIMP optimizer’s material layout for a drone frame"><br>Find where the material earns its weight | [**topology-simp: 3D topology optimization**](packs/topology-simp/PACK.md)<br>Give it loads, supports, keep-outs and a material budget. SIMP proposes a 3D density field for your model to turn into a part. | **Sourced:** SIMP, density filtering and projection from published methods. Extracted from PETGasus. NumPy, SciPy and Numba; pyamg for larger solves. Its own score is a proposal, never structural proof. |
| <img src="docs/img/packs/pcb-kicad-routed-board.png" width="320" alt="A routed keyboard PCB with copper traces connecting its contacts"><br>Routed keyboard board | [**pcb-kicad: autoroute**](packs/pcb-kicad/PACK.md)<br>Turn an unrouted KiCad board into a routed candidate. | **Freerouting**, an established autorouter. Its output is a proposal; KiCad gates check the adopted board. Requires pcbnew, Java and Freerouting. |

## External Packs

**A pack can live in its own Git repository.** You can share domain knowledge, wrap another engineering tool, or keep a project's custom checks alongside its design without changing Nopekit itself.

A standalone pack has a `pack.json` manifest, a `PACK.md` explaining its scope, and the gates, proposers, references and test fixtures it needs. Clone it into your project's `.nopekit/packs/<pack-name>/`, or into `~/.nopekit/packs/<pack-name>/` to make it discoverable across projects. `NOPEKIT_PACK_PATH` can point to other directories containing packs.

Then enable it by the name in its manifest:

```sh
nopekit packs list
nopekit packs validate <pack-name>
nopekit packs add <pack-name>
nopekit gate selftest --pack <pack-name>
```

`packs add` enables a discovered pack for the current project; cloning and updating its repository are separate steps. External gates also face mutation checks: Nopekit perturbs values from their known-good inputs to test whether the gates reject violations.

External packs can add specialized falsifiers, such as a product's crash or vibration tests, and proposal tools for domains the built-in packs do not yet cover.

To build your own, ask the agent to use Nopekit's **pack-authoring** skill. The [pack format](docs/PACK_FORMAT.md) defines the interface and the [extension protocol](docs/EXTENSION_PROTOCOL.md) explains how to develop and qualify a new capability.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Nopekit

Nopekit is one plugin for three agents: the repository root holds a manifest for each
(`.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`), and they share the same skills
and the same end-of-turn hook, which records each round.

**Claude Code.** Ask it:

> Install the Nopekit plugin from `https://github.com/neuman/nopekit` and help me get it ready to use.

Or install it directly with Claude Code's plugin commands:

```text
/plugin marketplace add neuman/nopekit
/plugin install nopekit
```

**Codex.** Codex reads the same marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add neuman/nopekit
codex plugin add nopekit@nopekit
```

Codex runs a plugin's hook only after you review and trust it, and asks again after
every update of the plugin. Until you do, rounds are not recorded at the end of a turn;
`nopekit round --commit` records one by hand.

**Cursor.** Clone the plugin into Cursor's local plugins, then restart Cursor:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/neuman/nopekit ~/.cursor/plugins/local/nopekit
```

To update, `git -C ~/.cursor/plugins/local/nopekit pull` and restart. Cursor can also
import the Claude Code plugin; install it one way, not both, or each turn ends with two
rounds.

You'll need Python 3.10 or newer available as `python3`. Nopekit's core has no third-party Python dependencies. Some checks need optional tools or packages; the agent should tell you when one is needed. For mesh checks used in 3D printing and solid-part work, install:

```sh
pip install trimesh numpy
```

### 2. Bring an idea

Open your agent in a project directory and say:

> I want to use Nopekit to design something new. Interview me about the idea, one question at a time. Help me turn what I want into requirements, explore possible designs, set up the project and its checks, and launch the project site so I can understand the design and follow its progress.

You can start with an empty folder, a sketch, existing CAD files or a half-finished design. The agent helps choose the relevant packs and explains any tools they need.

## Using Nopekit Step By Step

You work through this in conversation. The agent operates the tools; the project site lets you follow the work and question its conclusions.

1. **Describe the thing you want.** Say what it does, where it goes and what matters: size, load, price, materials, power or feel. The agent helps make those requirements concrete.
2. **Decide what would count as success.** Turn requirements into testable claims: “sags no more than 0.5 mm,” “fits this printer,” “costs under $150.” Identify which need calculations, simulations, measurements or human judgment.
3. **Explore candidates.** The agent builds the model or runs a proposer. It records the choices, their reasons and the alternatives that lost, so the next iteration can build on what you learned.
4. **Run checks and inspect failures.** Gates compare the candidate with its limits. Follow the evidence on the site, challenge assumptions, change the design and run again. A missing solver stays visible as a skipped check.
5. **Review what is ready.** The report separates current checks from assumptions, unresolved claims and physical tests. Changing the design invalidates affected evidence. Each milestone names what must be established before you spend on a prototype or fabrication.
6. **Build, measure and feed the results back.** Export reruns the required checks before producing a package. Record what happened to the real article; a physical failure becomes evidence for the next design. A simulation pass alone never establishes how the built object behaves.
