/** ``onProgress(loaded, total)`` follows the GLB's download (``total`` is 0

 *  the model stops the spin that ``setSpin`` started. Both are optional, and a
 *  caller that passes neither gets the viewer it had before (the front page's
 *  hero and the technical stage).
 *
 *  FIELD MODE (``field: true``, or a view of kind ``field``; issue #15): the
 *  colours on the mesh ARE the data, a colour scale the legend beside it
 *  explains, so the viewer shows them as the file holds them. Every mesh gets
 *  three.js's own ``MeshBasicMaterial`` with its vertex colours and no tone
 *  mapping, the scene gets no lights, and the renderer writes the colours to
 *  the canvas unconverted (``LinearSRGBColorSpace`` out, ``NoToneMapping``).
 *  Measured on 2026-10-21: ParaView 6.2's glTF exporter writes COLOR_0 as the
 *  colour map's own sRGB bytes (UNSIGNED_BYTE, normalized; Grayscale at 0.25
 *  is 64), so a pixel equals the byte only when nothing converts it;
 *  `tests/test_field_browser.py` holds a pixel to the ramp within 2. A field
 *  has no parts: tint, highlight, isolate and explode do nothing. What it
 *  closes before it could slip through: the three-point rig shades a scale's
 *  colours by the angle of each face, and a reader matches the shade against
 *  the legend (drawn lit, none of the test's four colours survived).
 *  *Rejected:* re-encoding the vertex colours into linear values ourselves (a
 *  GLB repacker is code a trusted tool already is); an unlit material with the
 *  renderer's default sRGB output (``KHR_materials_unlit`` alone): it encodes
 *  each raw byte again, and drew 64 as 137 and 128 as 188 (measured).
 *
 *  LIT FIELD MODE (``light: "scene"``, from the figure's sidecar; design P2):
 *  a solved field drawn as a scene, the way its still was drawn, so a reader
 *  reads the shape of the body and the paths of the air. Each mesh gets
 *  three.js's ``MeshStandardMaterial`` (roughness 0.6, no metal) with its
 *  vertex colours, under a rig that turns with the camera (``litRig``, not the
 *  model mode's lights, which are fixed in the world); normals are computed
 *  where the file has none (ParaView's glTF writes none, measured); the first
 *  view is the file's own camera when it has one, else the box's diagonal,
 *  and the view turns about the world axis nearest that camera's up
 *  (``orbitAbout``).
 *  Light and shade make a colour darker or lighter than the key's, so the
 *  viewer keeps the unlit material too, and ``setFlat(true)`` (the "Flat
 *  colours" toggle) swaps it in: then each pixel is the file's byte, as in
 *  the plain field mode, and `tests/test_field_browser.py` holds it within 2.
 *  The output stays ``LinearSRGBColorSpace`` with no tone mapping in both, so
 *  the toggle changes the material and nothing else. Faces are drawn on both
 *  sides, lit by the side the camera sees. *Rejected:* ``BackSide`` alone
 *  (ParaView's front-face cull on the motorBike body): it draws nothing of a
 *  mesh whose faces wind toward the camera, and which way a file winds is
 *  the exporter's (P7 checks the motorBike's baffles in the browser); an sRGB
 *  output for the lit material (the flat toggle would then move every
 *  colour of the key). */
