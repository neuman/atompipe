"""nopekit.site — the ledger, rendered and addressable.

The site has two jobs and the second one is why it exists:

1. **Explain the thing** to someone who did not build it.
2. **Debug the thing** — spin it, pull it apart, and see the latest gate results
   *anchored to the geometry they are about*.

A readiness report says ``cad.clash: 1 interfering pair — back_left /
grip_lid_left, 0.41 mm^3``. That is a sentence somebody has to go and act on.
The same verdict carrying two :class:`~nopekit.models.Locator` records lights
both parts up in the viewer, and the reader is looking at the problem a second
later. Everything in this module exists to keep that link intact from the gate
that measured the overlap to the pixel that turns red.

Five rules are mechanical here, not advisory:

1. **The site never computes truth.** It renders the ledger. Nothing in this
   module runs a gate, re-derives a measurement, or decides whether a claim
   passes — :mod:`nopekit.claims` and :mod:`nopekit.report` do that, and
   :func:`state` calls *them* rather than reimplementing the judgement. A page
   that reached its own verdict would be a second opinion published next to the
   first, and a reader has no way to tell which one is the design's actual
   status. If a number on the page is wrong, the ledger is wrong (rule 1 of the
   method: generated files are outputs, not sources).

2. **:func:`build` does not run gates.** It renders what
   :func:`nopekit.verdicts.resolve` makes of the verdict cache — which never
   runs a gate either — and stamps each verdict with its own age. A build that
   helpfully re-ran the cheap gates and not the expensive ones would publish a
   mixed-age picture under one timestamp — the tier-0 numbers from ten seconds
   ago beside the tier-2 numbers from last Tuesday, with nothing on the page
   saying which is which. Age is per gate for the same reason, and so is
   staleness: each verdict is current or not by its OWN inputs.

   What slipped through (S-28): this module kept its own copy of the staleness
   rule and of ``_flat_params``, "byte-for-byte" the CLI's, synced by a
   comment, and judged the whole page by one hash of the projection against
   the last sweep's. A page handed no resolution now asks the resolver itself;
   there is no generous default that lists recorded entries as current, which
   would serve every cached PASS whether or not its control was ever
   demonstrated (invariant 7 by omission).

3. **A locator that cannot be drawn is REPORTED, never dropped.** A gate that
   thinks it is drawing and is not looks exactly like a gate that found nothing,
   and the failure mode is silent on both ends: the pack author sees a passing
   import and the reader sees an unannotated verdict. :func:`locator_problems`
   names every locator addressing a view that does not exist or a node the view
   does not declare, and the problem list rides in ``state.json`` as well as in
   the build summary, so it is visible to the page and to ``curl`` alike.

4. **It degrades all the way down.** A project with no geometry — a chemical
   process, a supply chain, a bracket with nothing exported yet — still gets
   claims, verdicts, evidence, provenance and the readiness sentence. 3D is one
   view kind among six, not the point. A viewgen with nothing to draw returns
   ``None`` and that is a normal outcome, not an error.

5. **Extensibility lives in the data, not in shipped code.** A pack emits views
   in kinds the renderer already knows. Nothing here loads pack JavaScript: the
   one artifact whose entire job is to be trusted when a gate says something is
   wrong must not depend on code nobody reviewed.

The structure deliberately mirrors :mod:`nopekit.gates` — :class:`ViewContext`
for :class:`~nopekit.gates.GateContext`, :class:`ViewRegistry` for
:class:`~nopekit.gates.Registry`, :func:`viewgen` for
:func:`~nopekit.gates.gate`, :func:`run_all_viewgens` for
:func:`~nopekit.gates.run_all`. A pack author who has written a gate should
have to learn nothing to write a viewgen. The one asymmetry is deliberate and
is called out at :meth:`ViewRegistry.register`: a viewgen declares no negative
control, because it settles nothing and there is no claim to falsify.

Time policy (contract rule 3): nothing here reads the clock. ``now`` arrives
from the CLI edge as an ISO string; a verdict's ``when`` is the resolver's — the
obs run that last hit or wrote its entry, else the entry's commit time — and an
*absent* ``now`` or ``when`` produces ``age_s: null`` rather than a zero. A zero
age renders as "just now", which is precisely the lie a staleness display exists
to prevent.

No build step, ever. ``site/`` is plain HTML, CSS and ES modules;
``nopekit site build`` writes JSON and ``nopekit site serve`` is
``python3 -m http.server``. A project site that needs npm is a project site that
rots, and the spine is standard-library only for exactly the same reason.

SITE_DIR = "site"

#: Generated JSON, relative to ``site/``. Hand-editing anything under here is

DATA_DIR = "data"

ASSETS_DIR = "assets"

#: The two pages: the root `index.html` is a redirect to `engineering/`, the

#: beside it and never writes the root (`old_layout`). What slipped through the
#: plan: the build's shell loop had no `ensure_dir`, so a nested shell would
#: have raised on every existing project; and a page left out of this tuple is
#: a renderer file, overwritten on every build. *Rejected:* flat
#: `engineering.html` / `marketing.html` (the standard library's server, and
#: `site serve`, answer `/engineering` with a 404); the engineering page at `/`

#: 2026-10-21 (use the trusted tool's output, build as little as possible):
#: ParaView 6.2 writes glTF and no GLB (``ExportView`` with ``InlineData``),
#: and its faceted export passes the Khronos validator as it is (measured;
#: `tests/test_cfd_views.py`), so the page takes ParaView's file unchanged.
#: What a self-contained glTF closes: one that names a ``.bin`` or a texture
#: beside it would make the page fetch a file the spine never saw, hashed or
#: published. *Rejected:* a GLB repacker in the pack (the design's
#: ``_gltf.py``: a codec of our own between ParaView and three.js); trimesh
#: to convert (a second tool that rewrites the colours ParaView wrote, for
#: 25% fewer bytes the 2 MiB cap did not need: 940 KB for the baseline's 8000

        stating because a reader who knows that code will look for it. A gate is

          means every locator aimed at that name lights up whichever one

    Deliberately the same shape as `gates.load_project_gates`, because a viewgen is a

    `PACK`/`PACK_DIR` globals, same "an exception here is the pack author's
    problem and must not print as a spine traceback". A pack author who has
    written `gates/clash.py` writes `views/assembly.py` with nothing new to
    learn, which is the whole reason `site.py` mirrors `gates.py` field for
    field.

    Two details carry weight:

    * **Module names are salted with a hash of the file's absolute path**, so a
      pack's `views/assembly.py` and a project's `views/assembly.py` are
      different modules. Without the salt the second one to load silently reuses
      the first one's code while every message names the second file.
    * **Already-imported modules are re-registered from `fn.view_spec`**, not
      re-executed. Python will not run a module twice, so a second build in one
      process (a test, an agent that builds after every edit, `site status`
      after `site build`) would decorate nothing and find an EMPTY registry —
      reporting "this project has no views" about a project with six. The
      decorator attaches `view_spec` to the function precisely so a loader can
      recover the registration without re-running the module.

    Registering the same function under the same id twice is a no-op in
    `ViewRegistry`, so the walk is safe on a freshly executed module too, and
    the two paths stay one path rather than two that can drift.

    Four outcomes, and keeping them four instead of two is the job:

    * **a view** — it ran and produced something to render (note usually empty)
    * **None, "nothing to draw"** — it ran and had nothing. A CAD viewgen in a
      project with no geometry is not a failure and must not be one: the site
      degrades all the way down to claims and verdicts, and a project that never
      exports a mesh is a normal project, not a broken one.
    * **None, "unavailable: ..."** — its exporter is not installed. Reported,
      never silent: a view missing because trimesh is absent looks identical to
      a view the project never had, and the second costs nobody an afternoon.
    * **None, "error: ..."** — it crashed. A crashed viewgen is a bug in the
      viewgen; it does not stop the build, because the other views and the whole
      claims/verdicts half of the page are still true and still worth publishing.

    ``SystemExit`` and ``GeneratorExit`` are caught alongside ``Exception`` for
    the reason ``gates.run_gate`` spells out at length: pack code that reaches
    ``sys.exit()`` — an exporter's import guard, a stray ``argparse`` call —
    unwinds past an ``except Exception`` handler and out of the command, which
    then exits having written nothing and reported nothing. ``KeyboardInterrupt``
    is deliberately still allowed through: Ctrl-C during a slow mesh export must
    stop the build.

    A viewgen returning something that is not a ``View`` and not ``None`` is an
    error, not a view. There is no coercion here (unlike ``gates._normalise``,
    which accepts four shapes) because there is no natural shorthand for a
    picture: a ``dict`` that looks like a view is a view someone forgot to
    construct, and guessing at it produces a panel that renders wrong rather
    than a message that says what to fix.

         "extent": [...], "center": [...], "step": 18.4,
         "movers": {"lid": {"offset": [0, 0, 27.6], "nodes": [...], "rank": 2}}}

    Everything here is **derived, never asked for** (method rule 2), and the
    reason is specific rather than aesthetic:

    * **The thickness axis is the smallest global extent.** A stack is thin in
      the direction it stacks; that is what makes it a stack.
    * **Stack order is each mover's centroid along that axis, sorted.** A stack
      order is something the geometry already knows. Transcribing it into a
      hand-authored layer table is how it goes stale — the table is written once,
      a part moves to the other side of the board six revisions later, and the
      exploded view keeps showing the old order with total confidence. Nothing
      catches it, because nothing is comparing the table to the model.
    * **``step`` is ``max(thickness_extent × 1.15, 14)``** so parts clear each
      other at any scale, with a floor for geometry too thin to separate visibly.
    * **Movers left or right of centre fan outward on the widest axis**,
      proportionally to how far off centre they sit — a mover at the edge of the
      assembly fans a full step, one on the centreline does not move sideways at
      all. This is what makes a mirrored or two-handed assembly readable instead
      of collapsing both halves onto one column of parts. The magnitude is
      ``step`` again rather than a second tuned constant: the clearance that
      separates layers is the clearance that separates halves.

    Movers group by the node-name prefix before ``__`` (see
    :data:`MOVER_SEPARATOR`), so ``lid__boss_a`` and ``lid__boss_b`` travel with
    ``lid``. A node with no separator is its own mover. **Node names are an
    interface**: whatever a ``model3d`` viewgen names its nodes is what every
    gate in that domain must use in its locators, and that scheme belongs in the
    pack's ``PACK.md``.

    ``overrides`` merges **per mover**, so correcting one part does not mean
    transcribing the other twenty — which is the practical reason hand-authored
    manifests rot: the cost of fixing one offset is retyping the whole table, so
    nobody does it twice. Accepted in either shape::

        {"movers": {"lid": {"offset": [0, 0, 40]}}, "step": 22}
        {"lid": {"offset": [0, 0, 40]}}

    ``nodes`` cannot be overridden: node membership comes from the geometry, and
    an override that edits it is transcribing the thing this function exists to
    stop transcribing. An override naming a mover that does not exist is
    reported under ``stale_overrides`` rather than dropped — it means the part
    was renamed or deleted and a hand-edit outlived it.

    """Run the viewgens, write ``site/data/`` and ``site/assets/``, return a summary.

    **This function does not run gates**, and the omission is the point. It
    renders ``resolution`` — the caller's ``verdicts.resolve`` of the verdict
    cache. A build that re-ran the cheap gates on the way past would publish a
    page whose tier-0 numbers are ten seconds old and whose tier-2 numbers are
    a week old, and the reader has no way to tell them apart. If the results
    are stale, the fix is to run ``nopekit check``, and the page's job is to
    make the staleness impossible to miss, not to paper over it.

    Handed no ``resolution``, it resolves for itself (:func:`state`), against
    the projection it builds the views from: ``projection``, or — when the
    caller passed neither it nor ``model`` — the live model, loaded here. A
    model that does not load is not an error for the page; the resolver reads
    every verdict that read it as not current (S-21), and the build warns.
    ``params`` as for :func:`state`; handed none, they are the view of the model
    the build already holds. ``graph`` is the caller's `graph.build` over the
    same resolution (`round` hands its own, so the map and the round record
    share one graph); with none, `graph.of` builds it over the current
    design's trace. ``traced`` is the caller's `derivation.TraceRead`; with
    none, the build reads it (architecture phase 3b). ``live`` marks
    ``data/build.json`` live, so a page served by `site serve --watch` polls it.

    What it writes (architecture phase 5, SPEC 28-33), in this order: the
    renderer (`refresh_renderer`, never a shell), ``technical.html`` when absent,
    the clock's ignore line; the views and ``state.json`` (the technical
    record, clock-free); ``map.json`` and ``page.json`` (`page`), refused
    whole when `page.status_problems` finds a token the resolution does not
    say (invariant 14); the evidence copies; ``build.json`` last. Every tracked
    file is written only when its bytes differ, so a rebuild that judged
    nothing new changes no tracked byte and no mtime.

    ``registry`` is the *gate* registry; ``view_registry`` holds the viewgens.
    Both are parameters so a build can run against a scratch registry in a test.

    Returns a summary dict: what was written, what was removed, every viewgen's
    outcome, and — never merely available but actually said — ``warnings``,
    which is the list a CLI must print. The ledger is NOT written back: the site
    is an output and the records are the source (method rule 1).

    build resealed the page, so `site status` no longer said *edited by hand*.
    *Rejected:* leaving a kept row's numbers out of the prose pool (a clone
    without the tool would then mark numbers the page built with the tool
    matched, and the two computers would bake two pages from one set of

    One file, read once, with nothing behind a second request: claims with
    resolved status, verdicts with their locators and ages, views, parameters
    with their rationale **and their rejected alternatives**, inputs with what
    was extracted from them, capability gaps, decisions, and the readiness
    sentence. That completeness is a feature for humans and a requirement for
    agents — ``curl .../data/state.json`` has to be enough to answer "what is the
    status of this project?" without a browser, and an agent that has to render
    HTML to read a verdict will not read the verdict.

    The judgements are **borrowed, not recomputed**. Which verdict each gate
    has, and whether it is current, is ``resolution``'s — the one resolver's
    (:func:`nopekit.verdicts.resolve`, R-5); claim statuses come from
    :mod:`nopekit.claims` given the resolver's ``stale_gates``, the headline
    sentence, the words and the coverage logic from :mod:`nopekit.report`. Those
    are private helpers in ``report`` and reaching for them is deliberate: a
    second implementation would give the page and the readiness document two
    opinions about the same ledger, and the page is the one more people will
    read. One of the two would eventually be wrong and nothing would be
    comparing them.

    ``resolution`` — the caller's, laid over ``ledger`` as its verdicts. With
    none, this resolves for itself, against the live model (loaded here when
    the ledger names one). *Rejected:* a default that lists the recorded entries
    with nothing stale — a caller that forgot the keyword would serve every
    cached PASS as current and never ask whether its control was demonstrated,
    and nothing on the page would say so (judges 2 and 3, SF PD-07).

    ``stale=True`` is the all-stale override: every claim that would pass reads
    STALE, every row not current. ``None`` and ``False`` are no override at all
    — a caller cannot declare the cache current; only the resolver says what is.

    ``now`` is kept for callers and ignored (architecture phase 5, SPEC 32): the
    document is clock-free, and the build time and each verdict's age go to
    ``data/build.json`` (`ages`, `write_build_json`). ``judged`` is the
    caller's ``(view, composed)``, so a build composes once.

    ``params`` — the caller's :func:`nopekit.modelio.param_view` (the CLI's,
    which also names what a broken model's text states). With none, the view of
    the live model, loaded here as for ``resolution``. Never ``ledger.params``:
    what slipped through (review, checkpoint 1.3) — this read the records, which
    from 1.3 hold only what the model cannot (a source, a grounding), so the
    migrated bracket's page showed no parameter at all, and a record holding
    only ``"source"`` was shown at value ``null`` and flagged undefended while
    ``doctor`` said every parameter carried a rationale.

#: ``locator_problems``. (Until phase 5 it also left out the clock — the
#: build's ``built`` stamp and each row's ``when`` and ``age_s`` — which the
#: document no longer holds: they are in ``data/build.json``. Phase 3a's
#: ``judgement_digest`` is this function, renamed: "judgement" now names
#: nothing on the page, and the glossary's *judgment* is an expert's.) Everything else is judged, including keys a
#: later ``state`` adds: a new clock-like key makes pages read stale after every
#: check, which someone sees the same day; an unwatched judgement is the defect
#: this digest exists for (review, ``repro_site``). *Rejected:* an allow-list of
#: judged keys, which fails silent in exactly that direction; judging ``when``,
#: which a check that changed nothing moves (a cache hit is an obs run), so every
#: sweep would send the reader to rebuild a page whose every verdict still
#: stands (cli:H16's complaint, in a new place). The views are page furniture,
#: drawn by viewgens that a reader asking "is the page current?" never runs: a

#: old, and ``site build`` redraws it. Not a claim — no verdict rests on a view.
